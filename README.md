# Network Traffic Analysis and Incident Investigation

## Overview
This project investigates a simulated corporate network breach, conducted as part of the Security Blue Team’s Blue Team Junior Analyst Pathway. The primary objectives were to analyze network traffic, identify unauthorized activity, and diagnose the type of attack using industry-standard tools and techniques.

## Key Findings
- Identified a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack and pinpointed the attacker’s MAC address.
- Analyzed FTP traffic to uncover and extract a critical file downloaded from the central server.
- Extracted sensitive details, including the Domain Administrator’s SSH password and user data.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: For packet analysis and stream reconstruction.

## Steps
1. Enroll into Security Blue Team’s Blue Team Junior Analyst Pathway.
2. Access the network traffic files provided in Introduction to Network Analysis: Course Capstone here: [Activity: Network Analysis Challenge](https://elearning.securityblue.team/home/courses/free-courses/introduction-to-network-analysis#content#course-capstone#course-capstone#activity-network-analysis-challenge)
3. Open the `.pcap` file in Wireshark and apply filters to identify unusual traffic patterns.
4. Diagnose MITM attack characteristics by analyzing ARP requests and replies.
5. Review FTP traffic to locate a sensitive file and extracted embedded credentials using stream reconstruction.
6. Summarize findings.

## Learning Outcomes
- Enhanced proficiency in network packet inspection and stream analysis.
- Gained practical experience in diagnosing network attacks in real-world simulations.
- Strengthened understanding of network security protocols and their vulnerabilities.
